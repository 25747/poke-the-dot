# poke-the-dot
A game for my three-year-old, made in less than a day
See current build here: https://25747.github.io

## Libraries used
Chakra UI, one of my favorite React UI libraries. Simple, effective components, with plenty of customizability.

Vite, newer build/bundler tool, alternative to webpack. I haven't used it before, but heard great things. I was blown away with the build speed, both in development and when doing a production build. Dev builds happened in under half a second.

## How to use
clone to your machine, run 
```bash
yarn dev
```
to launch dev server
